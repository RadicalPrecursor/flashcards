What I want this to do:

Done: Accept a spreadsheet of verbs and alphabetize them
    This will let me pull the list back out and see what is and isn't on it

Done: Pull English definitions off the spreadsheet and ask for the plain translation
    pull random verb, loop until ctrl+c

Partially Done: Add to the spreadsheet source
    would like another input interface but whatevs

Start conjugation drills

Be able to choose which I'm doing
