What I want this to do:

Keep "score" somehow
    Create a separate document that updates each time
    Would be cool to preserve time information to see progress

More tenses in drills

Come up with some tests to be sure I don't break anything as I muck around

Add some nouns, and a noun mode
    noun mode should include gender
    Why does French assign everything a male or female gender?  EVERYTHING
    I wonder how non-binary people in francophone cultures handle this


****
Partially Done: Add to the spreadsheet source
    would like another input interface but whatevs

****
Done: Accept a spreadsheet of verbs and alphabetize them
    This will let me pull the list back out and see what is and isn't on it

Done: Pull English definitions off the spreadsheet and ask for the plain translation
    pull random verb, loop until ctrl+c
    Even better: closes upon "done"

Done: Be able to choose translation or conjugation

Done: Give correct answers after conjugation drill

Done: Allow a second try and then give correct answer in translation

Done: Present-tense conjugation drills
